\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of this document is to outline how we aim to enforce good testing practice, and as such contains a 'Test Specification' which demonstrates how to test against the different requirements as specified in the requirements specification\cite{se.qa.rs}, as well as displaying the criteria that must be met in order to pass tests.
\subsection{Scope}
This document specifically covers the 'Test Specification' section of the Test Procedure Standards Quality Assurance Document\cite{se.qa.tps}\\
\newline
This document should be read by all project members. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the Test Procedure Standards \cite{se.qa.tps}.
\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this document are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify where a test will be necessary against the requirements specification{se.qa.rs} and give it a unique ID. 
	\item Explain the exact function/requirement that is being tested.
	\item Explain how a user would undertake a test, as well as the desired output if successful.
	\item Explain the criteria that must be met by the test in order for it to be deemed as "Passed".
\end{itemize}

\hline
CLI-001 & FR8 & TaskerCLI should be able to identify the member upon logging in & Upon login, type an admins username and password and then press the login button Username: jsmithPassword: password; & A query should be sent to the database to locate the user with the data entered & The user will then be logged in and on the main page of TaskerCLI the current user will say "logged in as "jsmith"" \\

CLI-002 & FR8 & TaskerCLI should store the login details locally for future use & Upon login select the "remember me" checkbox and enter the details: UserName: JsmithPassword: password & Will run a query that will return a record with matching credentials and will be stored locally & When the program is restarted the user will be automatically logged in \\
\hline
CLI-003 & FR8a & TaskerCLI should be able to store data on the users computer locally for the user that is logged in & Login to a user (this will synchronise) & After synchronisation the program should save all the tasks that are allocated to them locally to a text file (located in the users home directory) & The text file will now display a table showing the tasks that were allocated to the member logged in \\
\hline
CLI-004 & FR9 & TaskerCLI should be able to synchronise to get all the tasks for the user that is logged in at the time and should only be ones that have a task status of 'allocated' & Login to a user that has tasks allocated to them with a status of 'allocated'. Then press the synchronisation button & A query will be ran to return all of the tasks that are allocated to the user and those tasks will be stored in a text file locally in the users home directory & The text file will contain a list of tasks that will be identical to those stored in the database that are allocated to the user that is logged in at the time and has a task status of 'allocated' \\

Also edit one of the tasks so that its status is 'abandoned' & A query will be ran to return all of the tasks that are allocated to the user and those tasks will overwrite the existing text file (removing any completed/abandoned tasks) & The text file will not display the task that was set to ?completed? and it will also not display the task that was set to 'abandoned' \\
\hline
CLI-006 & FR10 & TaskerCLI must be able to support local editing of tasks. (Task status) & Select a task from the list of tasks and then select to edit that task.

Edit one of the task elements notes to something different & The task element should have been updated in the database & The show tasks panel will now display the task with the updated task note \\
\hline
CLI-008 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen on start up & After logging in TaskerCLI will start and synchronisation will happen at this time. Check the local files to see if it has displayed all the current allocated tasks for that member in a text file & The TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and the local files will be updated & The local files should be updated straight after login \\
\hline
CLI-009 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen before editing a task & Edit a task in the database with SQL by setting its task status to 'completed'. Next; select the task (this should not show the updated task status yet) and click edit task & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and display the task with the updated task status that were input using SQL & Within the field boxes on the form in the edit task panel of TaskerCLI the newly updated task will be displayed showing the task status as 'completed' \\
\hline
CLI-010 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen after editing a task & Login to a user that has tasks allocated to them and select to edit one of the tasks and change its task status to 'completed' Press update. Proceed to check the database for this task to see if it has been updated by running a query & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and the new task will be shown in the database after the SQL query is ran & TaskerCLI will have synchronised and the query will return the field with the updated task status \\
\hline
CLI-011 & FR11 & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database every 5 minutes of it being logged on & Login to TaskerCLI and record the time of start. Update a task in the database whilst waiting for the 5 minutes to pass. Next: Refresh the show tasks panel after 5 minutes have passed from the start time & After 5 minutes TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and store the new updated task in the show tasks panel & The updated task will be displayed in the show tasks panel after refreshing when 5 minutes have passed \\
