\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Purpose of this document}
The purpose of this document is to outline how we aim to enforce good testing practice, and as such contains a 'Test Specification' which demonstrates how to test against the different requirements as specified in the requirements specification\cite{se.qa.rs}, as well as displaying the criteria that must be met in order to pass tests.
\subsection{Scope}
This document specifically covers the 'Test Specification' section of the Test Procedure Standards Quality Assurance Document\cite{se.qa.tps}\\
\newline
This document should be read by all project members. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the Test Procedure Standards \cite{se.qa.tps}.
\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this document are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify where a test will be necessary against the requirements specification{se.qa.rs} and give it a unique ID. 
	\item Explain the exact function/requirement that is being tested.
	\item Explain how a user would undertake a test, as well as the desired output if successful.
	\item Explain the criteria that must be met by the test in order for it to be deemed as "Passed".
\end{itemize}

UserName: 
Jsmith
Password: password & Will run a query that will return a record with matching credentials and will be stored locally & When the program is restarted the user will be automatically logged in \\
\hline
CLI-003 & FR8a & TaskerCLI should be able to store data on the users computer locally for the user that is logged in & Login to a user (this will synchronise), the data stored on the remote database will be pulled and displayed on screen, the data will then be stored onto a local database & After synchronisation the program should save all the tasks that are allocated to them locally to a text file (located in the users home directory) & The text file will now display a table showing the tasks that were allocated to the member logged in
 \\
\hline

\hline
CLI-008 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen on start up & After logging in TaskerCLI will start and synchronisation will happen at this time. Check the local files to see if it has displayed all the current allocated tasks for that member in a text file & The TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and the local files will be updated & The local files should be updated straight after login \\
\hline
CLI-009 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen before editing a task & Edit a task in the database with SQL by setting its task status to 'completed'. Next; select the task (this should not show the updated task status yet) and click edit task & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and display the task with the updated task status that were input using SQL & Within the field boxes on the form in the edit task panel of TaskerCLI the newly updated task will be displayed showing the task status as 'completed' \\
\hline
CLI-010 & FR11 & Synchronisation must happen after editing a task & Login to a user that has tasks allocated to them and select to edit one of the tasks and change its task status to 'completed' Press update. Proceed to check the database for this task to see if it has been updated by running a query & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and the new task will be shown in the database after the SQL query is ran & TaskerCLI will have synchronised and the query will return the field with the updated task status \\
\hline
CLI-011 & FR11 & TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database every 5 minutes of it being logged on & Login to TaskerCLI and record the time of start. Update a task in the database whilst waiting for the 5 minutes to pass. Next: Refresh the show tasks panel after 5 minutes have passed from the start time & After 5 minutes TaskerCLI should synchronise with the database and store the new updated task in the show tasks panel & The updated task will be displayed in the show tasks panel after refreshing when 5 minutes have passed \\
